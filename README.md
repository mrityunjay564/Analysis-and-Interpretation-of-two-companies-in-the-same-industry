# Analysis-and-Interpretation-of-two-companies-in-the-same-industry
● I utilized stock price information from two companies within the same industry and gathered data on CNX 
NIFTY to facilitate a comparative analysis. 
● Used the same data to compute the statistic like beta, systematic and unsystematic risk to help companies 
and other stakeholders make financial decisions. 
● Finally I interpreted the findings and made notes of the same for further communications.
